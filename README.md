# musicThreapy

This is the code repository for the music therapy website. It provides free Chinese classical music for people who suffer mental disorder or  negative emotions. 
The website is implemented using HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Bootstrap in the front end, and PHP at the server's side. The CMS needs to be added later.
